# Bank Account Simulation (Vanilla JavaScript)

This is a console-based banking simulation that I built while learning JavaScript objects and control flow.
It handles deposits, withdrawals, transfers, fees, interest, and basic currency conversion.

I later plan to add a simple UI to make it interactive.
