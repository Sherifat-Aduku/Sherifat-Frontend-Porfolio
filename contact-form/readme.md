# Contact Form

I built this simple, responsive contact form I built from frontend mentor challenge with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.  

It allow users to:  
- Enter first name, last name, and email  
- Select query type (General Enquiry or Support Request)  
- Write a message  
- Consent to being contacted  
- Submit the form with instant validation and success message  

I built this form with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
This project helped me practice responsive layouts, form validation, and interactive UI elements.
