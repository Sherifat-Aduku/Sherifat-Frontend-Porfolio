## Flower Shop Landing Page (Team Project – Figma)

This is a landing page for a flower shop that I worked on with my team in Figma with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The page looks clean and pretty, and it’s easy to navigate around the products.
My part: I worked on the hero section, making it look nice and grabbing attention. I also gave some ideas about colors and layout, and we all tried to make the design fit together.

I was able to add fuctionality to the nav links and I plan to turn it into a fully functional website later using react. See collaboration link: (https://github.com/MonjolaOluwa01/Mini-Project.git)
