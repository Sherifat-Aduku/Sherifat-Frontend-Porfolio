## Flower Shop Landing Page (Team Project – Figma)

This is a landing page for a flower shop that I worked on with my team in Figma.
The page looks clean and pretty, and it’s easy to navigate around the products.

My part: I worked on the hero section, making it look nice and grabbing attention.
I also gave some ideas about colors and layout, and we all tried to make the design fit together.

We plan to turn it into a real website later with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
