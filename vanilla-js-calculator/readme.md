# Vanilla JS Calculator

A simple calculator web app I built to practice JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

It allows you:

- Add, subtract, multiply, divide

- Use percentages and brackets

- Clear or backspace inputs

I built this with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

I made this project for me to practice handling user input and also updating the interface dynamically.
