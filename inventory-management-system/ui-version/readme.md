# Inventory Management System

This project was originally built with **Team 9 – Hackhunnies** as a console-based inventory management system at Tech4Dev. I decided to upgrade it by creating the **UI-based version** that helped me perform the below dynamically.

It enable users to:
- Add products and update stock
- Remove products from inventory
- Track low-stock items
- Generate inventory reports
-And also calculate total inventory value
