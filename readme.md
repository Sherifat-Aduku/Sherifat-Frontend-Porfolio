## Projects

This is a simple vanilla JS calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentages, and bracket support.

### [Contact Form](contact-form)
A fully responsive contact form built from a Frontend Mentor challenge.

I  created this dynamic inventory system to add, update, and remove products, track low-stock items, and calculate total inventory value in real-time.
