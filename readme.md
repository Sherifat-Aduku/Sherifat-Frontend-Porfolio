# Sherifat-Frontend-Porfolio
This repo contains my frontend projects using CSS, JavaScript, and React. It reflects my journey as a frontend developer, showcasing practical projects that helped me grow and also learn along the way.


### [Calculator](vanilla-js-calculator)
I built this simple vanilla JS calculator when I was running my scholarship programme at **Tech4Dev** with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentages, and bracket support.

### [Contact Form](contact-form)
This is a fully responsive contact form I built from a Frontend Mentor challenge.

### [Inventory Management System](inventory-management-system)
I created this dynamic inventory system while learning at Tech4Dev to add, update, and remove products, track low-stock items, and calculate total inventory value in real-time.

### [Bank Account Simulation](bank-account-simulation)
This is a console-based banking simulation that I built while I was learning JavaScript objects and control flow at Tech4Dev. It handles deposits, withdrawals, transfers, fees, interest, and basic currency conversion.

### [Flower Shop LandingPage](flower-shop-website)
Flower Shop Landing Page (Team Project – Figma) This is a landing page for a flower shop that I worked on with my team in Figma. The page looks clean and pretty, and it’s easy to navigate around the products.
My part: I worked on the hero section, making it look nice and grabbing attention.
I also gave some ideas about colors and layout, and we all tried to make the design fit together.
