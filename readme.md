### [Bank Account Simulation](bank-account-simulation)
This is a console-based banking simulation I developed while I was learning JavaScript objects and control flow at Tech4Dev. It handles deposits, withdrawals, transfers, fees, interest, and basic currency conversion.

### [Flower Shop LandingPage](flower-shop-website)
This is a figma landing page for a flower shop that I worked on with my team in Figma using html, css and javascript. The page looks clean and it’s easy to navigate around the products.
My part: I worked on the header, hero and the shop by occation section, making it look nice and grabbing attention.
I also gave some ideas about colors and layout, and we all tried to make the design fit together.
