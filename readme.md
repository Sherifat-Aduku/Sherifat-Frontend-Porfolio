# Sherifat's Frontend Portfolio

This repository showcases my frontend projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project demonstrates different skills in UI, DOM manipulation, and dynamic interactions.

## Projects

This is a simple vanilla JS calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentages, and bracket support.

### [Contact Form](./https://github.com/Sherifat-Aduku/Sherifat-Frontend-Porfolio/tree/master/contact-form)
A fully responsive contact form built from a Frontend Mentor challenge.

### [Inventory Management System](./https://github.com/Sherifat-Aduku/Sherifat-Frontend-Porfolio/tree/master/inventory-management-system)
I  created this dynamic inventory system to add, update, and remove products, track low-stock items, and calculate total inventory value in real-time.
